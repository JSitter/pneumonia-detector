# RSNA Challenge
The notebooks associated with this challenge use a conda environment that is installed locally on your computer. Once the conda environment is installed activate the environment using the command:
```
source activate tensorflow_gpu
```

If the required dependencies are installed as a different environment name, you can view all the installed environments using:

```
conda info --envs
```
