# RSNA Challenge
The notebooks associated with this challenge use a conda environment that is installed locally on the computer. Conda is already installed on this machine. To use the python environment type:
```
source activate tensorflow_gpu
```

If the required dependencies are installed as a different environment you can view all the installed environments using:

```
conda info --envs
```
